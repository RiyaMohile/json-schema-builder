# json-schema-builder

This project is a simple and modular **ReactJS** application built using **Vite**.  
It allows users to dynamically build and preview JSON Schemas in real-time.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **ReactJS** (via `@vitejs/plugin-react`)
- **Vite** – Fast build tool with Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
- **JavaScript** – No TypeScript used
- **CSS** – For component-level styling

## 📝 Task Notes

I have completed this task using **JavaScript** and **ReactJS**.  
I'm currently not experienced with **TypeScript**, but am open to learning it in the future.
